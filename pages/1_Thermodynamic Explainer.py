st.title("ðŸ§ª Thermodynamic Assumptions & Chemistry Explained")

st.markdown("""
This page explains how the **chemical and thermodynamic properties** used in the extraction cost model affect real-world metallurgy and commodity pricing.

---

### ðŸ”¥ 1. Temperature Dependence of Î”G

Gibbs Free Energy is temperature-dependent:

\\[
\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S
\\]

At high temperatures, reactions with positive enthalpy (Î”H) may still proceed due to entropy gains (Î”S).

---

### âš¡ 2. Electrode Potentials Are Not Fixed

Standard electrode potentials (EÂ°) change with:

- Ion concentration
- pH of solution
- Temperature

They are governed by the Nernst equation:

\\[
E = E^\\circ - \\frac{0.0591}{n} \\log \\frac{[\\text{Red}]}{[\\text{Ox}]}
\\]

---

### ðŸª¨ 3. Ore Composition and Extraction Energy

The **form in which a metal is found** (oxide, sulfide, carbonate, etc.) greatly affects the energy required to extract it.

- Oxides: easier to reduce (e.g., Feâ‚‚Oâ‚ƒ)
- Sulfides: require roasting and extra steps (e.g., CuFeSâ‚‚)

---

### ðŸ“ˆ 4. Real-World Cost â‰  Theoretical Î”G

While thermodynamics gives a baseline, actual costs depend on:

- Ore grade and impurities
- Environmental regulations
- Energy source (coal vs hydro)
- Scale of operation

This is why machine learning helps bridge the **gap between chemistry and economics**.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Understanding these principles helps explain **why metals like platinum or lithium** are expensive to extract â€” not just due to rarity, but **due to unfavorable reaction conditions or electrochemical instability**.
